## Notes:

# Access Token

For simplicity, access tokens are given a long expiration duration. In the real world, it's strongly recommended to limit the duration of access tokens and require a refresh token to 'refresh' expired access tokens.

# Database

SQLite was used for this project.

# Login & Passwords

By default, a login is required to access any resources.
