# Notes:

## Access Token

For simplicity, access tokens are given a long expiration duration. In the real world, it's strongly recommended to limit the duration of access tokens and require a refresh token to 'refresh' expired access tokens.

## Database

SQLite was used for this project.

## Login & Passwords

By default, a login is required to access any resources.

Admin: admin@gmail.com (with nonoverridable admin access)\
Password: 123456

Guest: user@gmail.com\
Password: 123456

Guest: test@gmail.com\
Password: 123456

## Access Permissions

Read permission is required to access any inventory endpoints to showcase the dynamic role-based system.

## Data

By default, there's only one product in the inventory. Use the frontend to populate the database with 1000 items.
